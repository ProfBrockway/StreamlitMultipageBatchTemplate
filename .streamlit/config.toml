# By default there is not an actual config.toml file as a file.
#    - Unless the user provides a config.toml file it's built dynamically
#      by streamlit at run time.

# To view the default config.toml settings
#   -In the Anaconda console:  streamlit config show

# A user created config.toml file should be located in folder:
#    C:\Users\{Your os user name}\.streamlit\

# In a user created config.toml file you only have to supply the values
#   you wish to change. All missing values will be generated by 
#   Streamlit at run time. For example this config.toml file 
#   changes only some theme settings and is otherwise empty.



[theme]
# This theme uses the Streamlit base theme 'light'
